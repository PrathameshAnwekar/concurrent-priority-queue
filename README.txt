Steps to run and execute program

1. Add the numbers which you want to insert into the tree in a file "data.txt"
2. Save the file to the same folder as the main.c file
3. Open terminal and locate the directory in which main.c is saved
4. Run the following commands one after the another

gcc main.c -o test
./test

After this the program will insert all the objects in 'data.txt' to the tree and then perform extractMin() and print the value till the tree is empty
